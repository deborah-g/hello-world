# hello-world
my first repository!
I just earned a master's degree in library science and I'm interested in working with biodiversity metadata.
Last week I was in Copenhagen at the Dublin Core conference and presented a poster about Schema.org's Movie Standard and how to improve it.
Now I'm learning how to do a pull request so I can share my recommendations with Schema.org.
